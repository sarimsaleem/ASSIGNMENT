    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>


<h2>Chapter 1</h2>


<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.On her desk,lying between the copies of<i>Nature,new scientist,</i>and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy <i>On the Road</i>.It had been Molly's favourite book since collage,and the longer she spend in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>

<p>She had spend the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an oscar Wilde quote proclaimmimg that "Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do".Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama DNA,to be an outatanding achivement, Molly did think she had somthing better to do.</p.
